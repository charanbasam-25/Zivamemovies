I have used https://www.themoviedb.org to fetch the movies list

For each movie i got, i created an Div element and styled it in format of Image , title and rating of it and overview of the movie

I also implemented the search operation at the header. Whenever we enter value in the search we get the movies according to the name we got from the search bar.

An i designed the each movie containers with flex box properties.

Css styling is used for styling the elements 

I also used the sematic tags for clear identification of elements.
